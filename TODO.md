# TODO

## Next

- Deserialize instance variables as JSON
- Deserialize Struct members as JSON
- Deserialize class variables as JSON
- Detect Cycles (perhaps by dumping object hashes as good-enough IDs)
- Deal with bypassing constructor args (perhaps providing an alternative to new)

## Soon

- Serialize/Deserialize direct Class occurence in variables as JSON
- Serialize/Deserialize direct Module occurence in variables as JSON

## Far Off
    
- Handle exception in instance variable matching class name
