# TODO

## Next

- Deserialize instance variables as JSON
- Deserialize Struct members as JSON
- Deserialize class variables as JSON
- Deserialize direct Class occurence in variables as JSON
- Deserialize direct Module occurence in variables as JSON
- Deal with bypassing constructor args (perhaps providing an alternative to new)
- Materialize a class matching the non-existing class
- Fix Set serialization to recurse just like Array

## Soon
