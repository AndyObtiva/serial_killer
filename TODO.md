# TODO

## Next

- Deserialize Struct members as JSON
- Deserialize class variables as JSON
- Deserialize classes and modules
- Support `include_classes` option on load
- Deserialize top-level Class occurence in variables as JSON
- Deserialize top-level Module occurence in variables as JSON
- Deal with bypassing constructor args (perhaps providing an alternative to new)
- Serialize whether a class reference is a class or module
- Materialize a class matching the non-existing class
- Support passing `whitelist_classes` to filter by upon load

## Soon


## Far Off
